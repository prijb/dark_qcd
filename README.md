# dark_qcd
NTuples used for my summer UROP in 2021 along with the code used for analysis.

analysis.C takes two NTuples (the portal and QCD .root trees) and compares jet and secondary vertex characteristics.  

Parameters for Portal filename (all strings):\
Decay portal of the Dark Meson (portal): vector/higgs/darkphoton\


Mass of the Dark Meson in GeV (mass): 5/15

Lifetime of the Dark Meson in mm (ctau): 10/50

xi = 1(for vector)/2.5(for higgs and darkphoton)

xl = 1(for vector)/2.5(for higgs and darkphoton)
